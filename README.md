
This ludumdare 25 project is still untitled.
The game jam theme was: You are the Villain

It isn't really a game yet, but more some experiments.
A proper version for this game will come out eventually :)

It was made using Unity 4.

IMPORTANT
Before cloning this project, after installing Unity3d 4.0, run MonoDevelop and disable Git plugin, this is due to a bug which prevent to have a Unity project under git source control.
In menu 'Tools'->'Add-in Manager'->'Version Control'->'Git support', click 'Disable'.
